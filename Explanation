WAN Simulation Assignment (NS-3)

This repository contains solutions for a Wide Area Networks (WAN) assignment implemented using the NS-3 network simulator. The project explores the design, configuration, and analysis of enterprise-scale WANs with an emphasis on reliability, performance, security, and scalability.

The assignment covers:
	•	Static routing and multi-site WAN topologies
	•	Redundant links and link-failure recovery
	•	Quality of Service (QoS) for mixed traffic (VoIP and data)
	•	WAN security concepts including IPsec and attack simulation
	•	Policy-based routing and SD-WAN-style traffic steering
	•	Inter-domain routing concepts using simplified BGP models

Performance is evaluated using FlowMonitor, focusing on latency, throughput, jitter, and packet loss under normal and failure scenarios.

This project demonstrates practical WAN design principles and how real-world networking behaviors can be analyzed through simulation.
